# 🌍 Population Distribution Visualization

This project visualizes the total population of the top 10 most populous countries using data from the World Bank. It was developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech** under the Data Analytics & Visualization program.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and represent population distribution across countries in a simple and understandable format. A bar chart has been created using Python libraries to help compare population sizes visually.

## 📌 Dataset

- **Source**: [World Bank – Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- **Data**: Total population figures for the year 2023

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting bar chart  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for development
